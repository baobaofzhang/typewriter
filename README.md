Typewriter is a Meteor app that brings distraction-free writing to the Kindle. After firing it up on your computer, point the Kindle's web browser to the Meteor app's IP and port. What you type in the computer's browser instantly appears on the Kindle. Typewriter also periodically saves drafts into a backup folder.
